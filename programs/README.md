Inside this folder, you may create files from which you can extract stored terms. It will be more practical if you're interested in keeping track of your creations. The file paths are assumed to take root from here, which means you're encouraged to use this as your working environment specifically for STLCE.

There's a file for default tests, ```default_tests.txt```, which could prove useful to anyone learning how STLCE works.
